# Getting Started

In this section we're going to go over the steps you need to take to start using Pluto in your own projects. It's going to go a bit more in-depth than the previous section, but without getting into any advanced concepts just yet.

In this section we will cover the following topics:

- The installation process of all the necessary tools
- Your first REST API project using the example code
- Features overview of the Pluto tooling
